#Contributing
Contributions to MTEM are encouraged and desired. If you're a user of one of the products, please correct or submit updates for the score sheets for any given product. If you notice any issues or disagree with the rubrics or scores, please file an issue. 

##Procedure
All rubric updates and general process changes are subject to approval by consensus.
Once a rubric update or process change are filed, they'll be open for at least a week for review and comment. If, at the end of the week, consensus is reached the update or change will be implemented. If not, the request will be left open for an additional seven days. If no consensus is reached, the request will be closed and may be reopened in the future if additional reasoning is provided. So the lifecycle of a request looks like this:
1. Submit a new rubric rule, an update for an existing rule, a new product for scoring, and update to a product's score, a new procedure, or an update to existing procedure as an issue via Github.
2. Requests will be open for a minimum of seven days to give people time to comment and discuss.
  * If the request has not achieved consensus after seven days, the request will remain open for a further seven days or until a consensus is reached, whichever passes sooner.
  * If after 14 days consensus has not been achieved, the request will be closed and may be reopened later.
  * Corrections do not require consensus, only evidence.
3. Once consensus has been reached, a milestone will be added and work will begin on implementation.
4. Once implementation has been written and applied, the issue will be closed.
